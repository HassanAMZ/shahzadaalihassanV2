summary: The BCI community is aware that involving the user in the loop is necessary to increase performance, and as a result, learning procedures must be improved. We have demonstrated that it is possible to propose fresh, promising methods for enhancing user performance by drawing on theories from other fields, such as the psychology of learning.

### Human Learning for Brain–Computer Interfaces

BCIs are communication and control devices that let people interact with their surroundings solely through mental activity. The first stage of the process involves the computer attempting to interpret the user's command. In Stage II, it is the user's turn to make an effort to comprehend the significance of the input the computer has generated. In most BCI systems, the user and the computer do not develop a mutual understanding in a proper manner. A user's ability to operate these systems is absolutely lacking for 15% to 30% of users.

<br />

How can we make this understanding easier to grasp? by offering customized learning procedures for every phase of the training loop. We shall examine the restrictions placed on the widely accepted standard protocols by the BCI community in section 11.2. We will concentrate on protocols designed to instruct users on using BCIs based on mental imagery (MI). This is the group of BCIs for which the learning procedure is most crucial. The Wadsworth center team's proposed BCI system is based on managing sensorimotor rhythms.

<br />

It involves a multi-trial learning method based on operant conditioning [WOL 00]. Every trial normally lasts for 8 seconds, during which a cross and a sound are played to draw the user's attention. Contrary to the BCI method from Graz, this type of BCI, which is based on operant conditioning, does not need the user to do any particular mental task. Users must develop a method that enables them to control their own cerebral rhythms in order to move the cursor across the screen. A review of the research on current BCI learning protocols is conducted with the goal of defining principles that will be helpful in the creation of new BCI training protocols.

<br />

The main goal of a learning protocol is to teach the user how to provide a steady, precise signal for each MI task they carry out. Learning how to utilize a BCI in a variety of ways is part of the Human Learning for Brain-Computer Interfaces (HBL) protocol. Numerous studies have demonstrated that when consumers are not provided with a specific approach at the start of the learning process, the best performance results are attained. In the common learning protocols, a bar or screen-based cursor is used to provide feedback. In certain research, different options for displaying feedback have been proposed.

<br />

Nijboer et al., for instance, employed the sounds of two different instruments in their auditory BCI to denote the recognition of each of the MI tasks. Sending more data through touch will have little to no impact on the workload required for human learning for brain-computer interfaces (HLI) in BCIs. Other research advice employs a variety of stimulators to give the user feedback. Feedback is provided using a variety of stimulation patterns based on the control-display mapping concepts. According to the results, users of BCIs who received tactile feedback performed better than those who received visual feedback.

<br />

According to this study, tactile input may improve BCI performance, particularly for interactive activities. Tactile feedback has, however, only sometimes been employed for BCIs, despite the fact that the performance gained with it is frequently compared to that obtained with visual feedback, and sometimes even greater. In order to improve human learning for brain-computer interfaces and maintain motivation levels, gamified learning protocols were created. McCraedieet al. [MCC 14] offered two straightforward games based on the ball-basket paradigm, for instance. Other studies also proposed gamified BCI learning procedures with virtual reality inclusions.

<br />

Games and virtual reality may boost motivation in the classroom, but it's also crucial to improve the clarity of the lessons and the applicability of practice exercises. It appears to be beneficial to increase both the quantity and quality of the information offered. We'll discuss an anthropocentric viewpoint that is now gaining traction in BCIs. It is based on a learning viewpoint that holds that people have personal traits that are ingrained in their cognitive profile, personality, etc. from their past experiences. Evaluation of the development of learners' emotional and mental states during the learning process has received growing attention.

<br />

These states can be measured using a variety of behavioral and physiological cues, including mouse movements, posture, and facial expressions (variations in heart rate, electrodermal response or breathing). VLCs, or virtual learning partners, were created in conjunction with ITS. Depending on the learner's profile and status, VLCs can be programmed to offer various types of feedback (social presence, emotional support, or cognitive assistance). Although it looks promising, the idea of an ITS created expressly for BCI learning poses several concerns. We've demonstrated that it's possible to suggest fresh, fruitful ideas for enhancing user performance by drawing on theories from fields like the psychology of learning.
