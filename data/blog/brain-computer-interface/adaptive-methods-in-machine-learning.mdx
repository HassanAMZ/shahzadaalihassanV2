summary: 'Learning to adapt to the diversity of signals captured by a brain-computer interface is the process of adaptive learning (BCI). We have discussed numerous adaptive learning techniques, which we have divided into two families: those that use statistical decoding and those that rely on generative models.'

### Adaptive Methods in Machine Learning

BCIs are instruments for communication and control that let people communicate and interact with their surroundings solely through their brain activity. In step I, the computer makes an effort to comprehend the user's command. Stage II is where the user tries to interpret the significance of the computer-generated input. The majority of BCI systems fail to develop a proper mutual understanding between the user and the computer. Some users—between 15% and 30%—find it impossible to operate these systems at all.

<br />

How can we help others grasp this? By offering tailored learning methods for each phase of the training loop. We shall examine the limits of the common standard protocols used by the BCI community in section 11.2. Since mental imagery-based BCIs (MI) is the type of BCIs for which the learning process is most crucial, we shall concentrate on protocols designed for instructing users on how to utilize them. Controlling sensorimotor rhythms is the foundation of the BCI system proposed by the Wadsworth center team.

<br />

It incorporates repeated trials and an operant conditioning-based learning process [WOL 00]. A cross and a sound are often displayed on the screen for the first eight seconds of each trial to draw the user's attention. Unlike the BCI method from Graz, this type of BCI, which is based on operant conditioning, does not impose any particular mental task on the user. Users must develop a method that enables them to control their brainwave cycles sufficiently enough to independently move the cursor across the screen. a survey of the literature on the many BCI learning protocols that are now in use with the aim of formulating principles that will be helpful in the creation of new BCI training protocols.

<br />

The ultimate goal of a learning protocol is to assist the user in developing a reliable, specific signal for each of the MI tasks that they carry out. The Human Learning for Brain-Computer Interfaces (HBL) protocol entails teaching users how to operate a BCI in a variety of ways. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the highest performance outcomes occur when users are not provided with a specific approach at the start of the learning process. Feedback is provided using an on-screen bar or cursor in the common learning protocols. Other options for displaying feedback have been presented by some studies.

<br />

For instance, Nijboer et al. used their audio BCI to identify each of the MI tasks using the sounds of two different instruments. The workload for human learning for brain-computer interfaces (HLI) will be minimally or not at all affected by sending additional information via touch for BCIs. Various simulators may be used, according to other investigations, to give the user input. As feedback, a variety of stimulation patterns based on the control-display mapping concepts are used. According to the results, tactile feedback enabled BCI users to perform better than those who only received visual feedback.

<br />

This work raises the possibility that tactile feedback could improve BCI performance, particularly for interactive activities. Tactile feedback hasn't been employed very often for BCIs despite the fact that the performance it produces is frequently compared to that of visual feedback and occasionally even superior. To keep people motivated and enhance human learning for brain-computer interfaces, gamified learning protocols were created. As an illustration, McCraedieet al. [MCC 14] proposed two straightforward games based on the ball-basket paradigm. Other research even advocated gamified BCI learning methods that included virtual reality components.

<br />

In the learning environment, games and virtual reality may boost motivation, but it's also critical to enhance the clarity of instructions and the applicability of practice exercises. It looks beneficial to increase the amount and caliber of the information offered. We'll discuss an anthropocentric perspective on BCIs that is now gaining traction. It is based on a theory of learning that holds that people have personal traits that are ingrained in their personalities, cognitive profiles, and other aspects of who they are as a result of their experiences in the past. The evaluation of how learners' emotional and mental states change during the course of learning is receiving more and more attention.
Different markers, including behavioral (mouse movements, posture, and facial expressions) and physiological (variations in heart rate, electrodermal response or breathing). In conjunction with ITS, virtual learning companions (VLCs) were created. Depending on the learner's profile and current state, VLCs can be set up to offer several types of feedback (social presence, emotional support, or cognitive assistance). A number of concerns are raised by the notion of an ITS created expressly for BCI learning. We've demonstrated that it's possible to provide fresh, fruitful ideas for enhancing user performance by drawing on theories from fields like the psychology of learning.
