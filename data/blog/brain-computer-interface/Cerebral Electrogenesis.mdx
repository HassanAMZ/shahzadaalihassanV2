summary: Pyramidal neurons, a crucial class of neurons in the cerebral cortex, are active when electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings are being made. EEG recording data is extremely valuable for scientific study in both medicine and neuroscience. Unlike EEG, ECG and EMG activities are far more extensive, and they can taint records.

### Anatomy and Physiology

At the end of the 1920s, Hans Berger was the first to utilize electroencephalography to capture electric brain activity in humans. It was not immediately accepted that these signals do in fact originate in the brain. The key to knowing the technology is to know what kinds of brain activity EEG can or cannot disclose. Through the bone and scalp, electroencephalography (EEG) captures brain activity remotely. In contrast, APs have a duration of around 20 ms, which is much longer than PSPs [KAN 00].

<br />

They are therefore the main drivers of EEG activity, despite their modest amplitude. Certain ions can move from one compartment to another through ion channels on postsynaptic neurons in the direction dictated by their electrochemical gradient. The direction (and strength) of each ion's tendency to travel toward one compartment or another is determined by the interaction of the chemical and electric gradients. Strong electrical and chemical gradients that push sodium 4 toward the intracellular compartment can be followed thanks to channels that are mostly permeable to that ion. The difference in potential between the interior and the exterior is decreased as a result of the net intake of positive charges.

<br />

It depolarizes the membrane, making the cell more amenable to excitability. EPSPs and IPSPs are produced by ion channel opening, which causes primary currents to giveaway to secondary currents. We must also take into account the contribution of particular ion channels depending on an intracellular ligand, even if opening the (dendritic or somatic) ionic channels is in fact the principal cause of observable changes in potentials recorded in EEG. There are electrical synapses, which are connections produced by the union of two pores, allowing currents to flow from one neuron to the next (one per neuron) A tiny "tunnel" spans each neuron's membrane, and the extracellular space separating them connects these junctions. Electrical synapses barely make any difference to the EEG.

<br />

An extracellular electrode recognizes the coexistence of a current source and sinks with the same intensity. A charge is not generated nor destroyed in the brain, according to the charge conservation principle. Although the geometry of dendrites and cell bodies is complex, if a neuron exhibits an asymmetry, its actions may frequently be explained by a straightforward model. The origins of EEG activity, which are primarily caused by synaptic activity, are frequently modeled using the dipolar model. It is important to keep in mind that this model depends on the kinds of approximations we just discussed.

<br />

The potential, V(P), produced by such a dipole at a point, has a rather straightforward formula. At the axon, a field is produced by an ion inflow (AP). The quadrupole word is the most important term in the expression of the potential produced by an AP. In comparison to PSP, APs contribute less to the EEG because of their smaller diameter and smaller exterior membrane surface. When specific ion channels in some neurons open in response to an intracellular ligand, a net flow of ions results, generating primary currents that lead to secondary extracellular currents.

<br />

It's also possible that some neurons have specific APs that rely on calcium channels rather than sodium channels to function. Additional to the sodium and potassium channels responsible for APs, various other types of voltage-dependent channels can give some neurons the ability to exhibit electric resonance. For instance, in relation to sleep spindles, thalamocortical neurons produce periodic bursts of APs. It is still not quite clear how directly they affect EEG. The electrochemical gradient for the ions conveying the current and the conductance, number, and a number of channels are the only factors affecting the current's strength.

<br />

The distance is influenced by the location of the synapses (or non-synaptic sources/sinks) and a number of neuronal shape-related variables. The shape of the group of neurons that are stimulated in synchrony determines the consequences of spatial summation at a distance. Each synaptic activation produces a current dipole with a unique moment. Since a stellate neuron's dendrites extend in a variety of directions away from the cell body, the corresponding dipole moment produced by adding all of its elementary dipoles is either equal to zero or nearly so. Asymmetries in the dendritic tree of neurons are referred to as "closed fields." Even if a population of many stellate neurons fires in sync, their fields don't provide enough current to be seen from a distance.

<br />

Pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex are responsible for producing the most significant portion of an EEG recording. The apical dendrites of those neurons are almost all parallel in a certain cortical region. An EEG can detect effects caused by the field created at a distance since it is sufficiently large. A negative deflection is produced by an EEG electrode positioned above a structure that generates an excitatory afferent volley. If the volley is inhibitory, it will result in scattered sinks along the remaining dendrites and cell bodies and point current sources at the synapses.

<br />

Similar to this, an EEG electrode will record a negative signal as the result of a deep inhibitory volley. The position of the generators affects the maximum value and shape of the potentials that the EEG electrodes can record. It is impossible to determine whether a negative EEG wave relates to shallow excitement or profound suppression. Since they are nearest to the surface, the cortical generators are the ones that contribute most to the activity that the EEG records.
