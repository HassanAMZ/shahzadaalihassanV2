Users' interactions with your website are displayed in behaviour reports. This can encompass a variety of factors, including as the information that users view and how they navigate between pages. Let's look at a few of the most helpful Behavior reports.

## Overview of behavior reports

The "Behavior" reports can be found in the left-hand navigation under "Behavior." Understanding how Google Analytics calculates behavior data is critical. If you recall, Analytics collects data from your website using a short piece of Javascript code. This tracking code creates a "pageview" in Google Analytics every time a user loads a page on your website. Many of the metrics in the Behavior reports are calculated using this. The "Total Pageviews" metric, for example, is just the total of each time a person loads a page on your website.

Let's start with the "All Pages" report, which can be found under "Site Content," and scroll down to the data table.

- The "Pageviews" measure reveals how many times each of your site's pages has been visited. This report will display data based on the page URI by default. The URI is the component of the URL that appears after the domain name in the browser's address bar. You can read this report by the title contained in the HTML of the web page if you change the primary dimension of the report to "Page Title."
- "Average Time on Page" and "Bounce Rate" are two other metrics in the "All Pages" report that show how engaged people were on each page of your site. You may sort the report by these parameters to rapidly identify underperforming pages that need to be improved, as well as high-performing content that can help you make better content decisions in the future.

The "Content Drilldown" report in the "Site Content" section aggregates pages according to the directory structure of your website. You can view the pages of your site within a directory by clicking on them. This is especially beneficial if you're attempting to figure out how well content in a specific portion of your website is performing. You can easily identify which portions of your site are the most popular by switching to the pie chart view.

Under "Site Content," then "Landing Pages" report reveals the pages of your website where users initially landed. In a session, these are the first pages that are viewed. This report can be used to track the number of bounces and bounce rate for each landing page. A high bounce rate usually means that the material on the landing page isn't relevant or interesting for those users.

Under "Site Content," the "Exit Pages" report displays the pages from which viewers exited your site. Because you don't want people to leave critical pages like the shopping cart checkout, it's a good idea to evaluate this report on a regular basis to prevent undesired departures.

The "Events" report monitors how visitors interact with various aspects of your website. This report can be used to track when people click on a video player or a download link, for example. Beyond the Analytics tracking code snippet, event tracking necessitates extra implementation, which we'll cover in greater depth in an advanced Google Analytics course.
