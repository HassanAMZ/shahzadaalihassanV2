## How to Distribute Reports

## Customizing and sharing reports

Once you've identified useful information in your reports, Google Analytics provides numerous options for sharing or referring back to that report by clicking on the report name at the top of the page.

- In the Customization area of the left-hand menu, under "Saved Reports," click "Save" to establish a link to the specific report.
- You can save a report to your desktop in a variety of file formats, including PDF and CSV.
- You can transmit a copy of the report as an attachment and even set up regular email updates using "Share."
- By adding metric groups, filters, or extra views to the report, you can personalize the information. This adds a new report under the left-hand navigation's Customization section, titled "Custom Reports." Custom Reports will be covered in the advanced course.

To see the proportion of sessions on which the report is based hover over the green check icon next to the report name. Because Analytics needs to chew through so much data at times, it will only examine a subset of the data obtained in order to return your report quickly. Because it returns an estimate of the precise count based on a sample of your data, this is referred to as "sampling.".

Mouse over the green data quality icon and select the pulldown menu to alter the report sample rate. Leave this set to "Greater Precision" if you want your data to be more exact and don't mind the extra reaction time. Select "Faster response" if you want to reduce the time it takes to compile a report and are willing to forego more precise measurements.
