## The structure of the Analytics account

Let's look at how Google Analytics accounts are organized now that you know how data is collected.

Optionally, you can group all of your Google Analytics accounts into an "Organization." This gives you the ability to manage several Google Analytics accounts from a single location.

Large companies or agencies may have many accounts, although medium and small firms typically only have one. When you establish an account, you also create a property and a view for that account within that property. Each Analytics account, on the other hand, can have many properties, each of which can have several views. This allows you to organize your Analytics data in a way that best reflects your company.

The Google Analytics Account controls how data from your websites is gathered and who has access to it. Typically, separate Analytics accounts would be created for different organizations or business divisions.

## View Settings

Each property can have many "views," just as each account can have several "properties." To choose what data you want to include in the reports for each view, use the Filters option in your configuration settings.

The Google Store, for example, sells products from their website in a variety of countries. They could combine all of their global website data into a single display. They could, however, construct different views for North America, Europe, and Asia if they wanted to see data for certain regions. The Google Store could create a view that filtered out internal traffic based on IP address if they only wanted to see data for external traffic (not including their own employees).

You can also set Google Analytics "Goals" at the view level. Goals are a great way to keep track of your website's conversions, or business objectives. A target could be the number of people that joined up for an email list or bought a product. In a subsequent session, we'll talk about goals and conversions.

Because you can't edit data once it's been collected and processed, be careful while setting up your accounts, properties, and views. courtesy of Google Analytics

Before we go into user access permissions, there are a few things to keep in mind about views:

1. Data from the date the view was created and forward is only included in new views. Past data will not be included when you create a new view.
2. Only administrators will be able to recover a deleted view within a certain amount of time. Otherwise, the view will be removed permanently.

## Users Permissions

You can give other users permissions at the account, property, or view level. The permissions of each level are inherited from the level above it.

If you have access to an account, for example, you also have access to the properties and views that are part of that account. However, if you merely have view access permissions, you won't be able to change the property or account associated with that view.

By selecting "Administrator," "Editor," "Analyst," or "Viewer," Google Analytics allows you to assign user responsibilities such as "Administrator," "Editor," "Analyst," or "Viewer."

1. Users can add or remove user access to an account, property, or view by selecting "Administrator" from the drop-down menu.
2. Users can make changes to the configuration settings using the "Editor."
3. Users can share dashboards and measurement settings using the "Analyst" feature.
4. Finally, "Viewer" allows users to see data, analyze reports, and create dashboards while preventing them from changing settings or adding new members.
5.

How your organizations, accounts, properties, and views are configured can have an impact on how your data is gathered. Make sure your properties and views of the data you collect are aligned with your overall business structure when setting up your Google Analytics setup.
