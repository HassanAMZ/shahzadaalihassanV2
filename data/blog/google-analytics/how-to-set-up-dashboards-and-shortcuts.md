Dashboards and shortcuts offer two ways of saving reports and metrics, so you can easily revisit them later. Lets understand the Universal Analytics Dashboard.

## Dashboards and shortcuts are introduced.

As we've gone over numerous reports, it's become evident that some of these indicators will be more relevant to your company than others. In some circumstances, you may wish to monitor certain data on a regular basis to assess the health of your company or a specific marketing campaign. You may find these metrics fast by using dashboards and shortcuts rather than going to a single report.

## Dashboards

Dashboards are adaptable and can be utilized for a variety of tasks. For example, you might use widgets to present summaries of many reports on a single page to obtain a quick overview of how your site is working. You may also compile a list of key business metrics that reflect the status of your company at a glance or compare reports side by side.

To see the reports you've collected, go to the left-hand navigation and click "Customization," then "Dashboards." Click Create to make a new dashboard, then choose a blank or starter dashboard and give it a name.

By choosing "Add Widget," you can add widgets to a dashboard. This will allow you to name the widget and choose a visualisation type for it to show on the dashboard. You can see the data as a number, a timeline, a map, a table, a pie chart, or a bar graph, among other options.

Some of these visualizations are available for conventional or real-time metrics. Use the "Add a metric" pulldown option to find and add the specific metric you'd like to include. After you've added the report widget to the dashboard, you can apply filters to it in the same way you did at the view level before.

After you've established a dashboard, click "Customize Dashboard" and choose a layout to format it. You may also move existing widgets about the dashboard by dragging and dropping them. When you hover your mouse over a widget, an edit icon appears, allowing you to make changes to the data that is being fed into the report widget. It also shows a delete icon, which you can use to remove the widget from your dashboard.

Dashboards are divided into two categories: private and shared. Within that view, a private dashboard is only available to you. Anyone with access to that view can see a shared dashboard. Each user can have 20 private dashboards and each view can have 50 shared dashboards. Other users can edit what appears on their dashboard if you share it with them, but their changes will only be visible to them. Another user cannot alter your initial shared dashboard.

Simply click "Share" at the top of the dashboard to share it. "Share Template Link" will provide you a link to your dashboard template that you may use in any other view, but it won't include any of your Analytics data.

If you want to share your dashboard template with a larger audience, select "Share in Solutions Gallery" to add it to the "Google Analytics Solutions Gallery." Users of Google Analytics can share various types of customizations, such as dashboards, in the Solutions Gallery. It's also a good location to look for dashboard layouts that you can download and adapt for your own company.

## Reports can be saved.

Most reports have a "Save" button at the top that allows you to save them for later viewing. Any adjustments you've made to the report are saved with the report when you save it. When you open the report from the Customization area under Saved Reports, for example, if you've filtered the data table, that filter will be applied immediately.

Use dashboards and Saved Reports to quickly access data that's important to your company and share it with others. For some fantastic ideas, look through the "Google Analytics Solutions Gallery.‚Äù
