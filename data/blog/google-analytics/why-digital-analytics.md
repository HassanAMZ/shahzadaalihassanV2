## **Defining Digital Analytics**

Let's start with a definition of "digital analytics" and why it's necessary. So, what exactly is the problem with digital analytics?

Well, most people buy things in phases.

We have the concept of a purchasing funnel in marketing. Within the funnel, there are various stages that characterize consumer interactions. The steps in a basic buying funnel are:

- Acquisition, entails raising user awareness and gaining user interest.
- Behavior, refers to how users interact with your Business.
- When a user becomes a customer and transacts with your company, this is referred to as conversion.

This process can be difficult to quantify in the offline world. However, in the internet world, we can use digital analytics to track many various components of the funnel. We can track which online behavior resulted in purchases and leverage that information to make more informed decisions about how to reach out to new and existing clients.

## **Digital Analytics in Practice**

Consider the Udemey as an example of an online store. Its purpose could be to sell more courses. The store might collect and analyze data from their internet advertising campaigns using digital analytics to identify which ones are the most effective and grow those marketing efforts.

The company, for example, may look at geographical sales data to see whether customers in certain areas buy a lot of courses and then conduct additional advertising campaigns in those areas. They might also employ analytics to figure out how people navigate their online purchasing carts. If they observe that people are having problems with a specific step on their website, they can make adjustments to the site to fix the issue.

Digital analytics can be beneficial to a variety of businesses:

- It can be used by publishers to build a loyal, engaged audience and better connect on-site advertising with user interests.
- Digital analytics can help ecommerce businesses better understand their clients' online purchase habits and sell their products and services.
- Lead generating sites can collect user information in order to link sales teams with possible leads.

While we've mostly talked about gathering data from websites, Google Analytics can also collect behavioral data from mobile apps, online point-of-sale systems, video game consoles, CRM systems, and other internet-connected platforms.

This information is gathered into Analytics reports, which you can use to conduct in-depth analysis to better understand your clients and their buying process. Then you can try out fresh ideas to help your company grow. While we've largely discussed collecting data from a website, Google Analytics may also collect behavioral data from a variety of sources, including mobile applications.
