## Views and Filters in UA

You can create several "views" of the data you've collected in Google Analytics. Within each view, you can apply filters to select what data will be available. Different views might help you focus on subsets of data or grant access to specific views to other people.

Click the "Admin" option at the top to discover what views are currently accessible for a property. Then click "View Settings" under View.

When you first establish a property, Analytics creates an unfiltered view called "All Web Site Data," as you can see. This is where you'll find all of the raw, unaltered data you gathered for the property. We recommend renaming it "Raw data" so that you know the data hasn't been filtered. We'll simply type in the new name to modify it. Now press the "Save" button.

## Creating a Demo View

We'll then create a "test view" to verify our settings. We may mistakenly lose data we want to capture if we configure something wrong. As a result, we should test all of our configurations first in this test view.

- Click the view selector pull-down menu in the top left to create a test view.
- Then choose "Create new view" from the drop-down menu. This view will be known as "Test View."

- Now select "Create view" from the drop-down menu.

This property is now in "Test View," as you can see. We recommend filtering your data for automated bot and spider traffic using an option in the test view.

- Select "View Settings" for this Test View.
- We'll then scroll down.
- Select "Exclude all hits from known bots and spiders" under "Bot Filtering." This will aid in the detection of bot traffic.

- Now press the "Save" button.

## Creating a Master View

Let's move on to creating the Master view. All of our reporting and analysis will be done using this view. We may just duplicate and rename the test view.

- Click "Copy view" in the top right corner to copy the view.

![Explanation Picture](/static/blog/00015_6.png)

- The view will be renamed "Master View."
- Now select "Copy view" from the drop-down menu.

You can see that we've successfully duplicated and created this new view by going to the View menu. All of our settings and filters, such as barring bot traffic, will be included in the new view if we replicate the view.

## Including More Filters

We now have three perspectives to back up our data, test new analytics configurations, and perform daily reporting and analysis.

However, filters are still required to select which data Analytics should display in each view. To exclude internal IP traffic, we'll first set up a common filter on the "Test" page. As a result, we can measure online Google Store behavior solely for external customers, with no effect from employees.

- Change the view choice from "Master View" to "Test View" in the right-hand column under "View." We'll be able to create our filters in the correct view if we do it this way.
- Now select "Filters" from the drop-down menu.

- Then select "Add Filter" from the drop-down menu. This filter will be called "Exclude internal traffic."

There are two types of filters available in Analytics: "Predefined" and "Custom" filters. Predefined filters are pre-made templates for the most often used filters. You can create custom filters to include, exclude, or alter data. We'll leave the filter type as "Predefined" because omitting data by IP address is usual, and Analytics provides a predefined filter for that.

- After that, select a filter type by clicking "Select Filter Type."

- Then choose "Exclude" from the drop-down menu.
- Now select "Select source or destination" from the drop-down menu.

- Select "traffic from IP addresses" from the drop-down menu.
- Finally, select an expression by clicking "Select expression." Then choose "that are equal to."

![Explanation Picture](/static/blog/00015_11.png)

- We'll now fill in the IP address that we want to block. By opening a new tab and typing "what is my ip?" into Google, you may get your public IP address.
- We'll now copy the IP address and paste it into the IP address area.

- Click "Save" towards the bottom.

It's worth noting that the newly constructed filter has now been included to the list of filters.

Google Analytics will verify the IP addresses of traffic to the web property and exclude those that fit the filter once we've saved and applied it to a view. The filter will take some time to catch up with all of the traffic. Click Reporting to make sure the filter isn't letting in any internal traffic. Then, on the left-hand navigation bar, select "Real-Time."

Select "Overview" from the drop-down menu.

![Explanation Picture](/static/blog/00015_14.png)

This gives you a snapshot of your website's real-time traffic. If you're on your company's internal network, you'll notice a decrease in internal user traffic during the next 30 minutes. Analytics will no longer gather internal activity for the IP address you filtered once the filters have taken effect.

You can add this filter to your test view once you've validated it works.

![Explanation Picture](/static/blog/00015_15.png)

You can apply this filter to your master view after you've validated it works in your test view. Click the Admin tab once again. Then choose View from the pull-down menu.
Choose "Master View" from the drop-down menu. Now select "Filters" from the drop-down menu. Then select "Add Filter" from the drop-down menu. Select the radio button for "Apply existing Filter" instead of "Create new Filter."
You'll be able to choose from a list of filters you've already set. Save the file.
The filter is now applied to the "Master View," as you can see.

![Explanation Picture](/static/blog/00015_16.png)

It's worth noting that if you apply several filters to a view, they'll be applied in the order in which they appear in your filter settings. As a result, if you have two filters, the data will go through the first one before moving on to the second. As a result, pay attention to the sequence in which you apply your filters.

It's that easy to create or add predefined filters to views to guarantee you're collecting and securing the data you need.
You will not be able to recover any data that was filtered out or reprocess historical data from before the filter was applied once you have applied a filter on data that you have collected in a view. So make sure you test any data you want to filter first in your Test view.
