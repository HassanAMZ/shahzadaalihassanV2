Ad campaigns can be a great method to get people to visit your site and build your business. Google Analytics can be used to track marketing initiatives run through Google Ads or other platforms. If you're using other platforms to promote, you may manually add Custom Campaign tags to marketing URLs to allow Google Analytics to track the campaign's success.

## How do you keep track of a marketing campaign?

Marketing initiatives come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Your company may want to advertise through text advertisements on search engine results pages, banner ads on selected publisher websites, or social media or email campaigns that inform customers about your brand and products. To drive sales and website conversions, it's customary to use a combination of these marketing efforts.

Google Analytics uses "campaign tagging" to track marketing campaigns. Campaign tags are additional pieces of information that you might include in the URL links of your online marketing or advertising products. Tracking parameters are followed by an equals sign and a single word or hyphenated words that you provide.

When users click on a link with parameters, the Google Analytics tracking code extracts the data from the link and associates that user with your marketing campaign. You'll be able to see who came to your site as a result of your various marketing efforts.

The Google Store, for example, sends out a monthly email newsletter to its clients that includes links to the Google Store website. The retailer may simply identify users who came to the website from the email newsletter by adding the campaign tag "email" to these links in Google Analytics.

There are five different campaign tags that you may use to find out more about your campaign's visitors. The campaign tags Medium, Source, and Campaign are all necessary. Tags for Content and Term can also be added.

When we first introduced you to Acquisition reports, we talked about medium and source.

- The term "medium" refers to the means by which you send your message to the user. You may use "email" to refer to an email campaign, "CPC" to refer to pay-per-click ads, or "social" to refer to a social network.
- The term "source" refers to the user's origin. This could be a link in an email or a specific web page. The type of medium could also be distinguished by the source. The source may be "google," "bing," or "yahoo" if the medium was "CPC" (or "cost per click" paid traffic). The source might be "newsletter" if the medium was "email."
- The term "campaign" can be used to convey the name of your marketing campaign, such as "2015-Back-To-School" or "2015-Holiday-Sale."
- The term "content" can be used to distinguish distinct versions of a promotion. This is useful for determining which version of an advertisement or promotion is the most effective. If you're comparing two distinct versions of an email, you could want to mark these tags "v1-10dollars-off" and "v2-no promo" to help Google Analytics figure out which one the data belongs to.
- For sponsored search campaigns, the term "term" is used to denote the keyword. If you're manually labeling a sponsored search campaign like Bing or Yahoo!, you'll just use this field. In a subsequent session, we'll discuss the best technique to track Google Ads.

Google Analytics provides a tool called "URL builder" in our Help Center, which we'll explore next, to add these parameters to the URLs connected with your ads.
