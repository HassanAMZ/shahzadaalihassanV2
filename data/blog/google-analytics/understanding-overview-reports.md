There are two kinds of reports in Google Analytics: “Overview” reports and “Full” reports. Let’s first walk through a guided tour of the Audience Overview report.

## Range of dates

Every report has a date range at the top. You can use this to specify the time frame over which you want to study report data. To use the date range selection, click the date range.

## Selecting a date range

On the left, you'll see a calendar where you may choose your date ranges. Changes to the date range have an impact on all of the reports in your view. As a result, you can move between reports without having to change the date range every time.

You can select from date periods such as the previous week, the previous calendar month, or the previous 30 days. However, by clicking the start- and end-date columns and selecting calendar dates, you can choose precise dates. Simply click on the name of the month in the calendar to the left to select the entire month.

## **Date Range Comparison**

A date range is listed at the beginning of every report. You can use this to specify the time period for which you wish to study the report data. The date range selection will appear once you click the date range.

## Segment Selector

Notice the segment picker at the top of the report. Segments are a means to compare metrics in a single data set. This will be covered in a more advanced course. For the time being, keep in mind that the default segment comprises all of the Users that visited your site within the specified time period.

## Graph in Line

The numerous metrics of the Audience Overview report are provided in several formats below the segment picker. The most prominent is a line graph, which by default displays a data point for the number of users on each day throughout the calendar range you specify.

## Selector for Duration

You may also adjust the data points to show hourly, weekly, or monthly data if you want to see it in more detail. This is very useful when looking at a big number of dates. If you're looking at data from a single day, the default display is hourly.

## Metric Picker

By selecting a different statistic from the drop-down option under the Overview tab, you may modify the metric given to users. By choosing "Select a metric," Analytics allows you to compare this to a second metric over the same time period.

## Annotator for Graphs

The small arrow at the bottom of the line graph should be noted. By clicking the arrow, you may add business context to your data by annotating the graph with helpful annotations. When you add an annotation to a graph, a little indicator appears on the graph that other users with access to the view may see. By selecting one of the metrics below, the data points for that measure will appear in the line graph above.

## Metrics

Underneath the line graph, there are a number of useful metrics:

- "Sessions" is the total number of sessions for the provided period range.
- "Users" refers to the total number of visitors who visited during the specified time period.
- "Pageviews" refers to the total number of times users saw pages that featured your Analytics tracking code. This includes a user's repeated reading of a single page.
- The average number of pages viewed during each session is referred to as "pages per session." This includes visiting the same page many times.
- "Average session duration" refers to the average length of a session based on users who visited your site within the specified time period.
- The percentage of users that left after seeing a single page on your site and taking no further action is known as the "bounce rate."
- The percentage of sessions in your date period that are new users to your site is called "percent of new sessions."

## Returning Users vs. New Users

A pie chart depicting the percentage of new vs. returning users is located to the right of the stats.

## Metrics and Dimensions

You may examine the top 10 dimensions and metrics in each category by clicking on the dimensions on the bottom left of the report.

## Dimension of Language

"Language" is the default dimension in the Audience Overview report. The top ten values for Language are listed in the table to the right. You can also display the top 10 values for each dimension by selecting "Country" or "City."
