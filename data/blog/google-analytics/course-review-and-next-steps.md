We expect you also to know how to use the Audience, Acquisition, and Behavior reports to perform basic analysis. Finally, we covered campaign tracking and how to build up targets for conversion tracking.

We also demonstrated how to link your Google Ads and Analytics accounts in order to track and optimize Google Ads campaigns.

## Steps to Follow

But first, let's take a look at a few more methods to use Google Analytics data to better your business.

Under Behavior, go to "Site Content" and select the "All Pages" report to view the top-performing pages for new users. Then add a "User Type" additional dimension to see which of your top sites are being visited by new users. This might assist you better understanding your site's content and marketing campaign plan in order to attract more visitors.

Go to the "Behavior" reports under "Site Content" and view the "Landing Pages" report to find unsuccessful landing pages. Sort by "Bounce Rate" to determine which pages are causing visitors to abandon your site without engaging with it. Add a secondary dimension of "campaign" or "source medium" if you're conducting campaigns and want to link these landing pages to your marketing efforts. Then you can look at which campaigns and landing pages are driving users away and make changes.

It's also crucial to know how users on various devices react to your digital marketing activities. Go to the Acquisition reports and select "Campaigns" and then "All Campaigns" to see user campaign data across devices. Then, in the report, add an additional dimension called "Device Category." It's now simple to examine what occurs when customers respond to your digital marketing efforts on different devices.

You may also use geographic data and Goals to improve the performance of your digital campaigns. Go to Google Analytics' Geo section and look for the Location report. Then, on the right, select a goal that interests you and sort by "Goal Conversion Rate" from the Conversions pull-down menu. This will allow you to identify which cities or nations had the best conversion rates and accordingly target those areas.

You should now be able to use Google Analytics to better understand your audience, increase website conversions, and improve the efficiency of your digital marketing. Remember to apply filters to your Analytics account and build trustworthy, accurate data by creating multiple views for testing. Set up goals to track your website conversions, and double-check that your marketing efforts are properly marked for tracking.
