## Navigating full reports: Part 1

## Introduction

A high-level version of the "Audience Overview" report was previously shown to you. There's a link to "see full report" at the bottom of that report, which takes you to expanded versions of each Audience report in the left-hand menu.

Let's have a look at the whole report now.

When you open the entire report, you'll notice links beneath the segment selector that control the report's many types of data. The "Summary" view gives you a quick overview of the dimension, with metrics for Acquisition, Behavior, and Conversion. This makes interpreting these KPIs in the context of the marketing funnel we discussed in Unit 1 a lot easier.

Users, sessions per user, new users, sessions, pages per session, and average session time are all displayed under "Site Usage." "Goals" will display metrics based on the number of goals you've set up, and it will only appear if you've set up goals in Google Analytics, which we'll cover later. If you've set up eCommerce tracking in Analytics, "E-commerce" will display your transaction stats. Let's go back to the Summary view now.

The main data table is located behind the graph. The current dimension "Country," which was the last demographic category we selected in the Overview report, is shown in the first column. By using the links above the data table, you can switch between additional dimensions such as city, continent, and subcontinent. It's also worth noting that you may add a third dimension to the table for an even more detailed examination. This is referred to as a secondary dimension, and it is a common data analysis tool. For example, you might add a "device category" dimension to the Location report to see what types of devices visitors in different nations used when accessing your website.

Each row of the table reflects a separate slice of traffic in the "Country" dimension, as seen here. Note that Analytics only displays the top 10 rows of data and as many columns as the screen allows. To show more rows, select how many rows you wish to see from the "Show rows" pulldown menu on the bottom-right side of the table, or use the left and right arrows to browse through 10 rows at a time. You may need to utilize the horizontal scroll bar at the bottom of the report to see all of the columns.

The data table can be analyzed in a variety of ways. The data sort is toggled between ascending and descending by clicking on each column in the table. The column header's arrow indicates which column you're presently sorting by. It's worth noting that Analytics sorts this data by users by default.

It's also possible to filter the data table to focus solely on the most important traffic segments. To include only rows where the primary dimension contains your filter term, use the filter field at the top of the table. If you want to look at data for a certain country, such as India, you can type "India" into the filter field instead of scrolling down the table, and Analytics will only show you data for segments that include the phrase "India." You can apply even more extensive filtering rules by selecting "Advanced" from the drop-down menu next to the search box. In an advanced course, we'll go over sophisticated filtering strategies.

## Visualization of Data

- There are various alternative visualization options next to the "advanced" link:
- For most reports, the "data table" view is the default visualization. For the audience and acquisition reports, this puts your data in a table separated by acquisition, behavior, and conversion metrics.
- The "pie chart" icon generates a pie chart depending on the information you provide. This allows you to compare aggregate percentages, such as the number of users on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. Using the pulldown menu, you can select which measure from your report should be displayed in the pie chart.
- A bar graph of your data is displayed in the "performance" section. This allows you to compare individual parts side by side, such as which nations have the most visitors. You may also select additional metrics to be rendered as bars using the pull-down menu.
- The "comparison view" displays a bar graph that shows whether each entry in the table performs better than or worse than the site average for the selected statistic. The value for a specific row appears green if it is higher than the average. It looks red if it is below normal. You can choose the metric to display using the drop-down option once more.
- Finally, the "Pivot" view generates a pivot table in which different dimension values can be displayed in both rows and columns for comparison. A pivot table, for example, may display the bounce rate and the number of sessions for each landing page and device type on The Google Store.
