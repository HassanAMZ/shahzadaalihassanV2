To track Custom Campaigns, Google Analytics includes a tool called "The URL Builder," which allows you to easily add campaign parameters to URLs.

## Using URL Builder to track campaigns

Click the link at the end of this lesson to go to the URL builder in the Help Center, then scroll down to the URL builder form.

In the first step, enter your website's URL (or where you want your ad or campaign link to take users). Then fill up the campaign, source, and medium fields. You can fill up the areas for term, content, and name if you want to. You can use any value for terms, content, and name; just make sure they're descriptive enough to recognize in your Google Analytics reports.

> A few words about name conventions. You'll usually name your tags using single words. If you use phrases, the URL builder will append underscores between the words to prevent spaces from appearing in the URL. When inputting tag values, make sure to utilize consistent spelling and capitalization. Due to the case sensitivity of Google Analytics, a campaign named "PROMO1" in all uppercase will appear separately from a campaign named "promo1" in all lowercase. Also, utilize consistent medium names for banner advertisements and email campaigns, such as "display" for banner ads and "email" for email campaigns.

When you click "Generate URL" at the bottom, you'll notice that the URL Builder creates a link that includes all of the campaign parameters.

This makes it simple to create campaign tags for tracking purposes. However, you can only use it to create one URL at a time, so if you have a large campaign, you won't want to use it to create each URL. To make the procedure easier, you can utilize a spreadsheet. At the end of this session, you'll find an example template for managing your campaign values for bulk URL-building.

You'll want to double-check that your tracking tags are working before running a campaign using this link. A website set might occasionally cause Google Analytics Campaign tracking to fail. Here's a quick and easy way to test your campaign before it goes live. To begin, open a private browsing session or an incognito window. Then, in the address bar of your browser, paste the link you made to track your campaign. Navigate around your website and execute some of the important steps once it has loaded. Complete the signup procedure on your website, for example, if one of your website objectives is trial signup. Alternatively, if your campaign includes a coupon, consider submitting a transaction that includes the coupon.

It's a good idea to do this for each URL you made. In the Real Time reports, you can examine campaign information right away, or you can wait a few hours to study the data in your usual Campaign reports. Then go to the "All Campaigns" report under "Campaigns" in the "Acquisition" section. This report allows you to compare the amount of traffic that has come in as a result of your various marketing strategies. Type the campaign's name into the filter to ensure that it is gathering data correctly. You should be able to see a summary of the campaign clicks you tested.

You can see the source and medium data you placed into the URL Builder by clicking on the campaign name. Add an additional dimension, such as "ad content," to your URL if you wish to double-check the other campaign tags you added.

This allows you to see the "Source/Medium" primary dimension broken down by the "content" tag you provided to your links. The Google Store used a separate "content" tag for their email newsletters depending on whether or not they were running specials. We can see which campaigns were most effective in driving people to the website by adding the secondary dimension of "Ad Content."

There are a variety of alternative methods for analysing campaign data, which we'll go over in detail in a later course. You can immediately understand which campaigns brought the greatest quality traffic to your site by using the URL Builder in conjunction with Google Analytics analytics.
