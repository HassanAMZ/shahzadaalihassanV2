## Overview of audience reports

Audience reports can be found in the left-hand navigation under "Audience." These reports can help you better understand your users' characteristics. This can contain information such as the nations they're from, the languages they speak, and the technology they're using to visit your website. However, it can also include information such as their age and gender, as well as their engagement and loyalty, as well as some of their interests.

## Report on Active Users

Let's look at the "Active Users" report first. This can show you how many users visited your site at least once in the previous day, seven days, fourteen days, and thirty days. This is referred to as "site reach" or "stickiness." The number of active users in each time frame should increase if your marketing activities and site content attract visitors to visit and return to your site.

## Reports on Demographics and Interests

Take a look at the "Demographics" and "Interests" reports next. The "Demographics" reports give you information about your users' age and gender. The "Interests" reports displaying your users' choices for several sorts of web content, such as technology, music, travel, and television. This data is beneficial in two ways. To begin, knowing your target audience might assist you in ensuring that you're reaching the proper people. Second, it can assist you in making marketing and content strategy decisions.

- To see data in these reports, you must first allow advertising features for each property in the "Demographics and Interests" reports. Select "Property Settings" from the "Admin" tab under "Property." Set "Enable Demographics and Interest Reports" under "Advertising Features."

Once active, you'll see information about your users' age, gender, and hobbies in your Demographics and Interests reports. It may take a day or two for data to emerge in these reports if you've just enabled this function. Additionally, if your site traffic is too low or your segment is too small, the Demographic reports may not contain any data.

## Reports on the environment

One of the most useful Audience reports is the "Location" report under "Geo." Google Analytics may use the IP address of a user's browser to establish their continent, subcontinent, country, and city anonymously. At the top of the report, you'll notice a geographic heat map that you may change to display different data. Switching the map to show "percent of New Visits," for example, allows you to find prospective new markets based on increased website traffic. This might assist you in deciding whether to increase client awareness or invest in customer loyalty in specific places.

You can also utilize the table below the image to find regions with a lot of conversions (or transactions) but not a lot of traffic. This could point to unexplored markets that could be targeted through advertising.

Another kind of study is to find places where you already have a huge audience but are performing below average. You may need to optimise your advertising or website if specific regions have a higher than average bounce rate (or users who depart after reading a single page). Perhaps your ad or website needs to be translated into the local language, or you need to incorporate locally specialised content.

## Reports on behaviour

Below "Geo," you'll find a variety of behaviour reports that will assist you to figure out how frequently visitors visit and return to your site. The "New vs Returning" report distinguishes between new and returning users in terms of acquisition, behaviour, and conversion target metrics. This comparison can be used to see how audience loyalty is changing over time. When examining the balance of new and returning users to your site, keep in mind your website objectives as well as your marketing initiatives.

## Reports on Technology and Mobile

The "Technology" and "Mobile" reports, which are found beneath the Behavior reports, might assist you to figure out what technology your audience utilizes to consume your site's content. These reports can assist you in fine-tuning your site to ensure that it works properly across a variety of devices and browsers.

You can utilize the "Browser and Operating Systems" report, for example, to rapidly identify browser difficulties on your site. You may need to construct a mobile-optimized version of your website with reduced content and simpler navigation if your site has a high bounce rate on mobile browsers.

It's also a good idea to figure out if people are shifting from desktop to mobile and adjust your development strategy accordingly. You can see a breakdown of your traffic by smartphone, tablet, and desktop devices in the "Overview" report under "Mobile." Check out this analysis to see how quickly your site's mobile usage has increased over time.

The "Devices" report provides further information about the devices that were used to visit your site. The name, brand, input selector, operating system, and other dimensions such as screen resolution are all included. These reports can provide guidance to your developers and designers on how to effectively create a mobile-optimized experience for your users.
