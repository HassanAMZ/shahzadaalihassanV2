## Goals in UA

Google Analytics goals allow you to link metrics in your reports to specific business objectives. This is a fantastic approach to use data to figure out if you're on track to fulfil your company objectives.

Let's make a distinction between two types of goals before we set up a goal in Google Analytics: business goals and Google Analytics Goals.

The actions you want your users to take on your website are known as business goals. A "conversion" occurs when a user completes one of your business goals. This could be anything as simple as signing up for a newsletter or purchasing a product.

However, in Google Analytics, you can track these conversions using a tool called "Goals." Analytics will create conversion-related data once you've configured Goals. such as the overall number of conversions and the conversion percentage of users This is known as the "conversion rate."

In Google Analytics, you may create a "goal funnel" when you create a goal. This is a data visualization illustrating the various actions that must be completed in order to achieve the goal. This diagram might help you figure out where users are abandoning the conversion process. Goals and funnels could be used by ecommerce organizations to see if users can finish a multi-step checkout procedure. Other companies might keep track of newsletter sign-ups, contact form submissions, page navigations, the number of pages viewed in a session, and time spent on the site.

You must be an Administrator on the View where you want to use Analytics to enable Goals. Also, keep in mind that each view can only include up to 20 goals, so think about which ones are most important to your company.

To begin, select what you want to track depending on your business objectives. Because The Google Store is an eCommerce site, they may track successful checkouts. So, whenever a user reaches the checkout confirmation page, let's set up a goal. We'll also create a funnel visualization to identify whether users are abandoning the process before reaching the confirmation page. This Goal will not track actual income; instead, it will track how far users progress through each stage of the goal and where they may abandon it. It's absolutely optional to create a funnel visualization to track target completions, but it can give a lot of visibility to each phase of the conversion path.

## Setup of Objectives

We'll begin by going to the Admin section. Then we'll select "Goals" from the "Views" menu. After that, we'll select "New Goal." Note that based on your business type, your Goal setup may differ from the one for The Google Store. Analytics comes with a number of pre-made business goal templates. We'll choose "Buy item" and click "Continue" since we want to see if customers made it to the Google Store checkout page.

We'll call the goal "Checkout Complete" because we want to keep track of checkout confirmations. Each goal has its own "Goal Slot ID," which ranges from one to twenty. The Goal Slot ID is an easy way to keep track of your objectives. The next available slot will always be the default slot. If this is your first goal, the Goal Slot ID will be "1," but if you have multiple objectives that you want to group together, you can choose a different slot.

After that, we'll select one of four Goal categories. A certain user activity triggers each of these categories.

- When a user arrives at a certain page on your site, such as a thank-you page, this is known as "destination."
- The term "duration" refers to the length of a user's session.
- The term "Pages or Screens" refers to how many pages a user views in a single session.
- Note that you can only use the "Destination"-type goal to generate a Funnel Visualization, so we'll select "Destination" and click "Continue."

We'll then type the "Order Complete" page's destination URL into the "Destination" column. When a user converts or completes the conversion process, the destination URL is the URL of the page that appears. Rather than typing the complete URL, we want to seek something unique in it that will allow us to track our goal solely through this page. We'll use this to identify our "Order Complete" page because none of the other web pages in the Google Store contain "submitOrder" in the URL.

We don't see any conversion data for this goal if we pick "Equals to," write "forward-slash SubmitOrder," and click "Verify" at the bottom. Because the SubmitOrder page is part of a larger dynamic URL, this is the case. We'll need to utilize a "regular expression" to track this aim, and enter the value "forward slash SubmitOrder" to signal that the URL preceding it can be changeable. When we select "Re-verify," we can see that the conversion rate is now greater than 0, indicating that we will be allowed to track data. Regular expressions will be covered in greater depth in an advanced Analytics course.

## Value of the Goal

If you want to give the conversion objective a monetary value, turn on the "Value" toggle and enter how much each conversion is worth. You'd utilize this only if each conversion was worth a consistent sum to your company. If each email sign-up is worth $1 to your company, for example, you could specify a goal value of "1." We'll leave this Value set to "Off" for now because we're tracking Google Store order completions and each order is different. We'd have to enable eCommerce tracking, which we cover in our Ecommerce Analytics course if we wanted to track actual revenue from purchases.

## Funnel with a Goal

To add the funnel steps, turn the Funnel switch to "On" after you've double-checked your settings. Each funnel stage indicates a website action that must be completed in order to achieve the Goal. In this situation, we'll need to provide a unique component of the URL for each page the user needs to see before checking out and making a purchase. We can give each phase in our funnel a name and include the URL's unique portion. Move the "Required" toggle to "Yes" if a step is required to fulfill the goal. Set the first step to needed, for example, if we only want users who entered the funnel on the first step to appear in our funnel visualization report.

> Note that the funnel you've set up will have no effect on the Goal completion statistics in the Conversions report, even if you've completed some of the required steps because these actions are only reflected in the funnel visualization report.

The Goal will display in the Goals list after you click Save.

Return to the Reporting view and click "Goals" and then "Overview" under the "Conversions" reports seeing your Goal stats. More crucially, target data is now visible in practically all other Google Analytics reports, including the Audience and Acquisition reports.

Click the Funnel Visualization report under Conversions to see the relevant funnel visualization. You can view user activity in each step of the funnel as well as how many people went through each step by scrolling down. If you notice a significant drop-off of users in a certain stage, you should look into it further. This level of the funnel may have technical challenges that prohibit consumers from moving forward.

In addition to generating your own goals, the Analytics Solutions Gallery contains a number of Goals created by other users that you can import into your Analytics account and utilize for your own business.
