## Welcome to a tour of the Account/Property/View switcher in the Google Analytics interface.

You can easily switch between them by selecting the pulldown menu in the upper-left corner that contains the title of your View.

You may get alerts about your Google Analytics properties and views by clicking the bell icon in the upper right corner.
