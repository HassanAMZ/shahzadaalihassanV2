Acquisition statistics may reveal how users find your website and how well your digital marketing and advertising campaigns are doing across various channels such as email, search, and display ads. These are some of Google Analytics' most useful and actionable reports.

## Overview of acquisition reports

Acquisition reports can be found in the left-hand navigation under the "Acquisition" section. The Acquisition reports can be used to analyze the success of various marketing channels and determine which sources offer you the best traffic and conversions. This might assist you in making more informed selections about where to concentrate your marketing efforts.

Before we get into Acquisition reports, it's important to understand how Google Analytics determines your website's traffic sources. The Google Analytics tracking code automatically records numerous attributes (or dimensions) regarding where a person came from when they visit your site. This contains the traffic source, medium, and name of the marketing campaign.

You might think of the medium as the vehicle that brought people to your website. "Organic," "CPC," "referral," "email," and "none" are some examples of mediums. Let's have a look at the many sorts of media:

- "Organic" refers to traffic that came to your site from an unpaid search result, such as a non-paid Google Search result.
- The term "CPC" refers to traffic that came from a sponsored search campaign such as Google Ads text ads.
- The term "referral" refers to traffic that came to your site from somewhere other than a search engine.
- The term "email" refers to traffic generated as a result of an email marketing campaign.
- "(none)" is used for visitors who arrive at your site by inputting the URL into their browser. You'll see that these users have a source of "direct" and a medium of "(none)" in your reports.

More information on the medium can be found under "Source." If the media is "referral," for example, the source is the URL of the website that referred the user to the site. The source will be the name of the search engine, such as "google," if the medium is "organic."

Let's look at the "Source/Medium" data in The Google Store Analytics account for the dates August 1, 2015, to August 31, 2015, under "All Traffic." This diagram depicts the sources of referrals, search engine traffic, and direct traffic to the site, as well as their corresponding channels. It's worth noting that users are the default sort.

We can look at the source/medium combinations with the most users to determine effective traffic sources, but that doesn't necessarily mean this was the best traffic. Users that arrive from a source should engage with the website or complete a conversion, hence traffic should be "high quality." Bounce rate is an excellent measure of traffic quality.

Our most popular traffic source is Google organic search, which has a lower bounce rate than other traffic sources. Direct traffic is our second most popular traffic source. Although YouTube referrals were the third most popular source of traffic, they also had one of the highest bounce rates. Let's do some additional research to see if this is a problem.

To compare bounce rates for each source/medium combination to the site average, go to the comparison view and choose the metric "bounce rate." Our YouTube traffic is bouncing at a considerably higher rate than the site average, as we can observe. The Google Store might want to look at ensuring that YouTube traffic is directed to a page that is useful to those users.

We could type "organic" into the filter to view only "organic" sources generating traffic to the site. As you can see, Google referred more traffic than any other non-paid source and had a lower bounce rate than the others. This means that users who arrive via Google Organic search are directed to pages that are highly relevant to them.

Now, by changing the filter to "google," we can compare the performance of all of our numerous Google marketing campaigns that generated traffic. We can now see that organic traffic accounted for the majority of our traffic, followed by google/cpc, which indicates sponsored search traffic generated by Google Ads. This is a terrific method to put your analysis into context and figure out which marketing actions are yielding results for your company.

## Report on the Channels

Other methods of determining which traffic sources produce the most engaged users to the site exist. We may view traffic by channel using the "Channels" report, which groups the sources together under each medium. Organic, Social, Direct, Referral, Display, and other traffic sources are automatically categorized into fundamental categories (or channels).

By selecting each channel and clicking on it, you may see the individual sources for that channel. You can construct your own channel groupings in Google Analytics if you wish to arrange your sources differently. In a more advanced course, we'll go over this in greater detail.

## Report on Referrals

You can glance at the "Referrals" report to see your traffic categorized by which sites have connected to yours.

You may even look at individual referrals to see which web pages connect back to your website. You can add a supplementary dimension of "landing page" to the report if you want to know which specific pages of your site are being linked to. This will show you which external websites are sending traffic to each of your individual pages, as well as provide you with a potential source of new advertising relationships with those referring sites.
