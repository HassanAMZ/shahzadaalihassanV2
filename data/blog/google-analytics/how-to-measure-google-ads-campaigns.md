Google Ads is a great tool for promoting your business on Google's web domains. To measure the impact of ad campaigns on your business, integrate your Analytics account with Google Ads.

## How to Use Google Ads Analytics

Google Ads is a text and display advertising system developed by Google that allows businesses to create text and display ads. By matching terms you can bid on with consumers' search queries, text adverts appear next to Google search results. Display advertising is text, image, animation, or video adverts that appear on the Google Display Network, which is a large collection of websites.

The Google Store might bid on phrases like "Google t-shirt" and "Google clothing" if they wish to sell t-shirts. When consumers search Google for a specific product, such as "a really cool Google t-shirt," Google Ads will display a related text ad for the Google Store if the ad passes the quality requirements set by Google Ads. This form of advertising can help you reach out to the millions of people who use Google Search and the Display Network on a daily basis.

When you link your Google Analytics and Google Ads accounts, you'll be able to:

- In Google Analytics, you can see Google Ads click and cost data alongside your site engagement data;
- create remarketing lists in Analytics to utilize in Google Ads campaigns;
- transfer Analytics objectives and transactions into Google Ads as conversions,
- and see Google Ads site engagement data.

To create a Google Ads account, go to the link provided at the conclusion of this session and follow the instructions. It should take no more than 20 minutes.

To link Google Analytics and Google Ads, make sure you're logged into Analytics with the same email address you're using for your Google Ads account. In the upper right-hand corner, you'll see the email address you used to sign in. It's worth noting that you'll need to be an administrator on both accounts.

Alternatively, select the Admin tab. Then double-check that you've chosen the correct account and property to link to your Google Ads account. Select "Google Ads connecting" from the Property section. Select "New link group" from the drop-down menu. Any Google Ads accounts linked to your Google account will display automatically. Select the account you want to link and then click "Continue." After that, provide a "Link Group Title." It's possible that this is your Google Ads account ID.

Select "Link accounts" in the view where you want the Google Ads data to appear. With the title you entered, the linked account will appear in your Link group list.

## Auto-tagging

Campaign data is exchanged between the two systems when you link your Google Analytics and Google Ads accounts, but campaign tracking is still required. Although we previously used the URL Builder to manually add campaign tracking tags to Google Ads URLs, there is a better solution. Through a tool called auto-tagging, Google Ads may automatically add a custom campaign tag to your Google Ads URLs. To obtain certain Google Ads dimensions into Google Analytics, you'll need to use auto-tagging. The following are some of the Google Ads dimensions:

- The query match type displays how a Google Ads term is related to a user search query.
- The ad group connected with the keyword/creative and click is displayed in the Ad Group.
- The Google Advertising destination URL set in your Google Ads ads is displayed in the Destination URL field.
- Ad Format specifies whether the ad is a text, display, or video advertisement.
- Ad Distribution Network displays the ad distribution network that was utilized to distribute your ad.
- The domain where your ad was shown on the content network is known as the placement domain.
- The Google Ads Customer ID is a one-of-a-kind identifier for your Google Ads account.

All of this information might help you better understand how well your Google Ads campaigns are performing. The Ad Format dimension, for example, can be used to easily compare the performance of various ad formats. You can also fine-tune your keyword matching technique by looking at how well your keywords perform based on the sort of match they have. These extra dimensions and reporting options are only available when your Google Analytics and Google Ads accounts are linked.

We can locate Google Ads reports under "Acquisition" in the left-hand navigation once we've integrated Google Ads to Analytics.

## Campaigns

We can see how well our various Google Ads campaigns are performing by going to the "Campaigns" report. It's worth noting that this report groups Google Ads campaigns by the names they've been given in Google Ads. This is one of the advantages of tying Google Ads and Analytics together.

You may choose between desktop, smartphone, and tablet stats at the top of the report to see how campaigns performed on different devices. The Acquisition metrics in the data table below can be used to see how many clicks each campaign received and the total cost paid for those clicks. The average cost per click (CPC) is displayed. Each campaign's user involvement may be found under Behavior. Using the pulldown menu under Conversions, you can see the conversion rate, the number of actual target completions, and the value of these conversions to your business for each Google Ads campaign.

## Keywords

Let's take a look at the "Keywords" report now. This might assist you in determining how well specific keywords and ads are doing. If a term generates a lot of traffic yet has a high bounce rate, it could indicate a mismatch between the ad and landing page content. If you have a keyword with a high conversion rate but a low number of impressions (the number of times an ad is displayed), you might want to increase your bid for that keyword so that the ad is displayed more frequently and reaches a wider audience. You may also add "Device Category" as an additional dimension to separate these keywords based on the devices visitors used to click your ad and visit your site.

## Adjustments to bids

Let's take a look at the "Bid adjustments" report last. Bid adjustments are a Google Ads feature that adjusts keyword bids automatically based on the user's device, location, or time of day. For example, if the Google Store builds a temporary location to sell products during the holidays, they may wish to add a bid adjustment to boost ad visibility on mobile devices within three miles of the store during operating hours.

The Bid Adjustment report in Analytics allows you to look at the performance of your Google Ads campaigns based on the bid changes you've made. You can examine campaign results by device, location, time of day, and remarketing list bid modifications using the selector at the top of the table. In an advanced course, we'll go over remarketing. Click on a campaign's name in the list to see all of your bid modifications and stats for that campaign.

When Google Ads and Google Analytics are combined, you can see how powerful Google Ads can be for your business. It enables you to fully comprehend the worth of your marketing efforts and make adjustments to boost your ROI.
