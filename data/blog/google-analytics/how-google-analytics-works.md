## The procedure for gathering data for analytics

Google Analytics is a data collection technology that aggregates information into helpful reports.

## Keeping track of a website

You must first register a Google Analytics account in order to track a website. Then, on each page of your site, put a little bit of JavaScript tracking code. The tracking code will collect anonymous information on how a user engaged with a webpage every time that user sees it.

The tracking code for the [Shahzadalihassan.com](/) might reveal how many customers visited the home page vs a blog page. It could also tell us how many people bought a product by tracking if they got to the payment confirmation page.

However, the tracking code will collect information from the browser, such as the browser's language setting, browser type (such as Chrome or Safari), and the device and operating system used to visit the [Shahzadalihassan.com](/). It can even collect the "traffic source," which is the source of users' visits to the site. This might be a search engine, a click-through advertisement, or an email marketing campaign.

## Reporting and Processing

When the tracking code gathers information, it packages it and transmits it to Google Analytics, where it is processed into reports. Analytics aggregates and organizes data based on specific criteria, such as whether a user's device is a mobile or desktop computer, or which browser they're using.

However, you can alter how that data is processed using configuration options. For example, you might want to use a filter to ensure that your data doesn't include any internal corporate traffic or only data from a specific area or region that's significant to your firm.

And, there's one thing you should keep in mind.

- After Analytics has processed the data, it is saved in a database that cannot be modified.

This is an excellent point. So, when you're setting up your settings, don't leave out any data you think you'll want to look at later. The data will appear in Google Analytics as reports once it has been processed and stored in the database. Later, we'll show you what these reports look like.
