summary: Assuming known stationary signal and noise spectra and additive noise, the Wiener filter is a filter used in signal processing to provide an estimate of a desired or target random process through linear time-invariant (LTI) filtering of an observed noisy process. The mean square error between the intended process and the estimated random process is reduced by the Wiener filter.
